# API Documentation Projects

This repository contains multiple API documentation projects designed to demonstrate structured, production-ready API documentation practices.

As a technical writer specializing in API documentation, I created these projects to showcase not only writing skills but also documentation architecture and developer experience thinking.

Each Project includes a complete documentation set such as API references, guides, authentication flows, and supporting materials.

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to showcase how different APIs can be documented using industry-standard approaches such as OpenAPI (Swagger), structured Markdown documentation, and developer-focused writing. 

These projects are designed to simulate real-world API documentation scenarios.

<br>

## Documentation Approach
All projects follow these principles:
- Clear structure and consistent formatting
- Separation between reference and conceptual documentation
- Realistic request and response examples
- Developer-friendly explanations
The focus is not only on describing endpoints but on building usable developer documentation.

## Current Projects

### [1. Eventbrite API Documentation](./Eventbrite_API/docs/README.md)
A structured documentation project based on the public Eventbrite API.
Focus areas include:
- Endpoint reference structure
- Authentication documentation
- Developer guides
- Error handling

### [2. Trackit API Documentation](./TrackIt_API/docs/README.md)
A fictional but fully structured API specification project created to demonstrate OpenAPI-based documentation skills.
This project includes:
- OpenAPI specification file
- Human-readable API reference
- Request/response examples
- Organized documentation structure

<br>

## Upcoming Projects
Additional API documentation projects will be added over time. This is designed to grow as new documentation projects are completed.

## About API Documentation Projects
This project is part of a broader API documentation portfolio focused on practical, structured, and scalable documentation design.
